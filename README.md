# Master-Thesis-Drilling-Mud-Sumps
This page is created by Renate van Mulligen for her Master Thesis.
This page contains all scripts that is used in my master thesis.
As I have used two different coding types/programs, Python and Google Earth Engenine (which uses JavaScript), I have created two folders.
In these folders are the script placed for the respective coding type.

In the Google Earth Engine scripts folder the scripts are txt files, due to not downloading the code from the GEE site
The files are: Temperature_and_Precipitation.txt for the temperature and precipition script, Elevation_and_Slope.txt for the elevation and slope script
and Snowfall.txt for the snowfall script.
