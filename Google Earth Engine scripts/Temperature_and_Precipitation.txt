// In this code, the precipitation and temperature data of the drilling mud sumps will be extracted

// to a yearly mean or sum database. The mean or sum depends on if temperature (mean) or precipitaion (sum) 
// is the chosen band.

// The following code is about combining the FeatureCollection of all the years and the ERA5 monthly database 
// using the Join.saveAll feature of GEE with an equal filter. This means that all the years in the ERA5 monthly
// database which equals the FeatureCollection of all the years, will be but in the Feature of the same years. The 
// join is applied while also transforming the FeatureCollection to an ImageCollection for preperation of the next
// steps of the code.
